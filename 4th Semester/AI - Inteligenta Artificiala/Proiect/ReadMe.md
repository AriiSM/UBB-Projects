## Project Overview
This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures, specifically sign language digits from 1 to 9, as well as gestures for "like" and "palm." The core of the project is a smart Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to identify these gestures with high accuracy.

### Key Features
- **Gesture Recognition**: The CNN model is capable of identifying a range of hand gestures used in sign language.
- **Background Elimination**: The application includes advanced background elimination techniques. These techniques allow the app to focus solely on hand movements in live video feeds, enhancing the accuracy of gesture recognition.
- **Real-Time Processing**: The tool processes gestures in real-time, making it practical for applications in accessibility and human-computer interaction.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the potential of combining computer vision and deep learning technologies to create real-time gesture recognition tools. Such tools can significantly improve accessibility and usability in various computing environments.
